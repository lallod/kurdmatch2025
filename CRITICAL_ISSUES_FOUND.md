# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES - DO NOT LAUNCH

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** BLOCKING PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

---

## ‚õî IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Issue #1: PROFILES TABLE PUBLICLY EXPOSED
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** ALL USER DATA ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE

**Problem:**
- Every user profile is readable by anyone on the internet without authentication
- Includes: names, ages, locations, physical descriptions, religious/political views, relationships, occupations
- Anyone can scrape all Kurdish user data for stalking, harassment, identity theft

**Current Policy:**
```sql
"Anyone can select profiles" ON public.profiles FOR SELECT USING (true)
```

**Required Fix:**
```sql
-- Remove public access
DROP POLICY "Anyone can select profiles" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY "Anyone can insert profiles" ON public.profiles;

-- Add authenticated-only access
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles"
ON public.profiles FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);
```

---

### Issue #2: REPORTER IDENTITIES EXPOSED
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** USERS CAN SEE WHO REPORTED THEM

**Problem:**
- Reports table allows users to view their own reports
- This reveals who reported them (reporter_user_id visible)
- Enables retaliation and harassment of reporters

**Current Policy:**
```sql
"Users can view their own reports" ON public.reports FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = reporter_user_id)
```

**Required Fix:**
- Remove user access to reports
- Only super admins should view reports
- Implement anonymous reporting

---

### Issue #3: RLS NOT ENABLED ON TABLES
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** UNRESTRICTED DATA ACCESS

**Problem:**
- Some tables don't have RLS enabled
- Data is accessible without proper security checks

**Required Fix:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.photos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... etc for all tables
```

---

### Issue #4: INFINITE RECURSION IN GROUP_MEMBERS POLICY
**Severity:** üî¥ ERROR  
**Impact:** GROUP FEATURES NOT WORKING

**From Logs:**
```
ERROR: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "group_members"
```

**Problem:**
- RLS policy on group_members references itself
- Creates infinite loop
- Blocks all group-related functionality

**Required Fix:**
- Create security definer function
- Rewrite policy to use function instead of direct table query

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 5. Function Search Paths Not Set
**Impact:** Security vulnerability in function execution  
**Fix:** Add `SET search_path = public` to all security definer functions

### 6. Leaked Password Protection Disabled
**Impact:** Users can set compromised passwords  
**Fix:** Enable in Supabase Auth dashboard

### 7. Payment Data Not Encrypted
**Impact:** Sensitive financial data at risk  
**Fix:** Add encryption for payment fields

### 8. Message Security Gaps
**Impact:** Private messages could be exposed  
**Fix:** Implement encryption at rest

## üìã DATABASE MIGRATION STATUS

**Attempted Migration:** FAILED (Deadlock)
```
ERROR: 40P01: deadlock detected
Process 2050514 waits for AccessExclusiveLock on relation 17737
Process 2050513 waits for AccessShareLock on relation 17670
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Run migrations in smaller batches
2. Fix critical issues first (profiles, reports)
3. Then fix high priority issues
4. Finally address warnings

## üîç CONSOLE LOGS ANALYSIS

### Working Features ‚úÖ
- Registration form loading correctly
- Questions fetching from database
- Form default values being set

### Potential Issues ‚ùå
- Multi-select fields using empty strings instead of arrays
  - Affected: languages, interests, hobbies, values
  - May cause registration failures
  - Need to verify in `formDefaultValues.ts`

---

## üö´ CANNOT LAUNCH UNTIL

- [ ] Profiles table access restricted to authenticated users
- [ ] Reports table protects reporter identities
- [ ] RLS enabled on all tables
- [ ] Infinite recursion in group_members fixed
- [ ] Function search paths set
- [ ] Security scan shows 0 critical issues

---

‚úÖ Console logs reviewed  
‚úÖ Network requests checked  
‚úÖ Database linter run  

### Pending
‚ùå Fix critical security issues  
‚ùå Re-run security scan  
‚ùå Test registration flow end-to-end  
‚ùå Test all user journeys  
‚ùå Cross-browser testing  
‚ùå Mobile responsiveness testing
