# Security Audit Report - KurdMatch Platform
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - DO NOT LAUNCH

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. ‚ùå PROFILES TABLE PUBLICLY EXPOSED
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Risk:** All user data accessible to anyone without authentication

**Issue:**
The `profiles` table is publicly readable, exposing:
- Full names, ages, exact locations
- Physical descriptions (height, body type, ethnicity)
- Religious and political beliefs
- Relationship status and goals
- Occupation and education details
- Personal lifestyle information

**Impact:**
- Data scraping for stalking/harassment
- Identity theft targeting Kurdish users
- Targeted scams and social engineering
- Privacy violations and GDPR non-compliance

**Fix Required:**
```sql
-- Remove public access policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can select profiles" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can insert profiles" ON public.profiles;

-- Add authenticated-only policies
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view profiles"
ON public.profiles FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);
```

---

### 2. ‚ùå REPORTER IDENTITIES EXPOSED IN REPORTS
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Risk:** Users can identify who reported them

**Issue:**
Users can view their own reports, which includes `reporter_user_id`, potentially leading to retaliation.

**Fix Required:**
- Remove user access to view own reports
- Only allow admins to see reporter information
- Implement anonymous reporting system

---

### 3. ‚ùå RLS DISABLED ON CRITICAL TABLES
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Risk:** Unrestricted data access

**Tables Affected:**
- Need to verify which specific tables have RLS disabled

**Fix Required:**
- Enable RLS on all tables
- Create appropriate access policies

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. Payment Data Security
**Issue:** Payment table accessible by super admins without additional safeguards
**Risk:** Potential data leakage if admin account compromised
**Recommendation:** Add encryption for sensitive payment fields

### 5. Private Messages Protection
**Issue:** Messages could be exposed through policy bypass vulnerabilities
**Recommendation:** Implement encryption at rest, stricter access controls

### 6. Function Search Paths Not Set
**Issue:** 2 functions without `search_path` parameter
**Risk:** Security vulnerability in function execution
**Fix:** Set `search_path = public` on all security definer functions

### 7. Leaked Password Protection Disabled
**Issue:** Auth doesn't check against leaked password databases
**Recommendation:** Enable in Supabase Auth settings

---

## üìã MODERATE ISSUES

### 8. Extensions in Public Schema
**Issue:** PostGIS and other extensions in public schema
**Recommendation:** Move to dedicated schema

### 9. Postgres Version Outdated
**Issue:** Security patches available
**Recommendation:** Upgrade Postgres version in Supabase dashboard

---

## üîç FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES FOUND

### Console Logs Analysis
‚úÖ **Working:**
- Registration questions loading correctly
- Form default values setting properly
- Database queries executing successfully

‚ùå **Issues:**
- Multi-select fields setting as empty strings instead of arrays (languages, interests, hobbies, values)
- Need to verify this doesn't cause registration failures
